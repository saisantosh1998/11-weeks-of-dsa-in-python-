Question:
	
Given arrival and departure times of all trains that 
reach a railway station. Find the minimum number of 
platforms required for the railway station so that no 
train is kept waiting.Consider that all the trains 
arrive on the same day and leave on the same day. 
Arrival and departure time can never be the same 
for a train but we can have arrival time of one train 
equal to departure time of the other. At any given 
instance of time, same platform can not be used for 
both departure of a train and arrival of another train.
 In such cases, we need different platforms,.

Solution:

def minimumPlatform(n,arr,dep):
  
  
   
    plat=1
    i=1
    j=0
    result=1
    arr.sort()
    dep.sort()
    while i<n and j<n:
        if arr[i]<=dep[j]:
           plat+=1
           i+=1
        else:
            plat-=1
            j+=1
        if result<plat:
            result=plat
    return result
