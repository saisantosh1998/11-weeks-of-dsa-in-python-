Question:
	The intersection of two arrays 
contains the elements common to both the 
arrays. The intersection should not count
 duplicate elements.
Solution:

def printIntersection(a, b, n, m):
   
   
    l=[]
    s=set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(a[i])
    for j in range(m):
        if b[j] in s and b[j]!=b[j-1]:
            l.append(b[j])
    if len(l)==0:
        return -1
    return l
