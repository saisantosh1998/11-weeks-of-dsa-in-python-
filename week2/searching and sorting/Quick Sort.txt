Question:
	Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. 
It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given 
array around the picked pivot.

Solution:

def partition(arr,low,high):
    i=low-1
    pivot=arr[high]
    for j in range(low,high):
        if arr[j]<=pivot:
            i+=1
            arr[i],arr[j]=arr[j],arr[i]
    arr[i+1],arr[high]=arr[high],arr[i+1]
    return(i+1)
