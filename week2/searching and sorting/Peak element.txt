Question:
	A peak element in an array is the one that 
is not smaller than its neighbours.Given an array 
of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.

Solution:

def peakElementUtil(arr, low, high, n): 
    mid = low + (high - low)/2 
    mid = int(mid) 
    if ((mid == 0 or arr[mid - 1] <= arr[mid]) and 
        (mid == n - 1 or arr[mid + 1] <= arr[mid])): 
        return mid 
    elif (mid > 0 and arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]): 
        return peakElementUtil(arr, low, (mid - 1), n) 
    else: 
        return peakElementUtil(arr, (mid + 1), high, n) 
def peakElement(arr, n): 
  
    return peakElementUtil(arr, 0, n - 1, n)
