Question:
	Given an array A of N positive numbers. 
The task is to find the first Equilibium Point 
in the array. Equilibrium Point in an array is 
a position such that the sum of elements before 
it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Solution:
def equilibriumPoint(A, N):
   
    if N==1:
        return 1
    leftsum=0
    s=sum(A)
    for i in range(N):
        s-=A[i]
        if s==leftsum:
            return i+1
        leftsum+=A[i]
    return -1
