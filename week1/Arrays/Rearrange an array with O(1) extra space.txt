Question:
	 Given an array arr[] of size N where every 
element is in the range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the
given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].
Solution:
def arrange(arr, n): 
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i]+=(arr[arr[i]]%n)*n
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i]=int(arr[i]/n)
    return arr
