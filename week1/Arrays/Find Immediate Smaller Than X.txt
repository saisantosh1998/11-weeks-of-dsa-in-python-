Question:
	 Given an array arr[] of size N containing 
positive integers and an integer X, find the element 
in the array which is smaller than X and closest to it.



Solution:
def immediateSmaller(arr,n,x):
        smaller=-1
        for i in arr:
            if i<x and i>smaller:
                smaller=i
        return smaller
