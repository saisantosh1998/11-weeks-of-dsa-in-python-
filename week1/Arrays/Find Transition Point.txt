Question:
	 Given a sorted array containing only 
0s and 1s, find the transition point. 


Solution:
def transitionPoint(arr, n):
    l = 0
    h = n-1
    
    while(l <= h):
    
        mid = l + (h-l)//2;
        
        if(arr[mid] == 1 and (mid-1 < 0 or arr[mid-1] == 0)):
        
            return mid;
        
        elif(arr[mid] == 1):
        
            h = mid-1;
        
        else:
        
            l = mid+1;
        

    
    return -1
