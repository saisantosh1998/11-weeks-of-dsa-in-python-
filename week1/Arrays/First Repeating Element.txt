the first repeating element. The element should 
occurs more than once and the index of its first 
occurrence should be the smallest.

Solution:
def firstRepeated(arr, n):
    s={}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] not in s:
            s[arr[i]]=True
        else:
            s[arr[i]]=False
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[arr[i]]==False:
            return i+1
    return -1
