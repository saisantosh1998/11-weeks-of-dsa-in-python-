Question:
	 Given an array arr[] of size N and 
two elements x and y, use counter variables 
  to find which element appears most in the 
   array, x or y. If both elements have the 
same frequency, then return the smaller element.
Note:  We need to return the element, not its count.

Solution:
def count(x):
        count=0
        for i in range(n):
            if x==arr[i]:
                count+=1
                    
        return count
def majorityWins(arr, n,  x,y):
    mid=int(n/2)
    if count(x)==count(y):
        return min(x,y)
    else:
        if count(x)>count(y):
            return x
        else:
            return y
